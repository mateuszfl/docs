# B2B components

The B2B Components allow merchants top pick and compose B2B capabilities as they need it. They allow them to create a b2b e-commerce experience they want to have for their business partners and enable agencies to customize shopware according to their specific requirements. This means that B2B components can be
turned on or off individually for every Business Partner.
